# WeatherApp

Weather App as the name implies allows the user to enter their preferred city and view it's weather forecast in terms of the temperature, precipitation and other fields such as wind speed. In this application, I have integrated REST APIs from open source WeatherAPI.com to fetch the weather forecast using the HTTP Library Volley.
